<h2>Lover</h2>
<div>

<p><font size="4"> Lover is a pop-related album. In this album, Taylor Swift wrote songs about her being really happy. She was embracing herself more and more. In some songs, she was also talking about certain public issues that needed to be adressed like homophobia in You Need to Calm Down and she was also addressing gender inequality in her song The Man. Most of all, I love Cruel Summer and Lover since it has this bubbly vibe like my personality.

<p><font size="4"> Midnights is also a pop-related album. It achieved a total of 973 million streams in a week. This song gives a mix of in love, heart broken, and happily single. My favorite songs are Mastermind, Bejeweled, and Midnight Rain.
